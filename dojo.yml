  Welcome to the Docker Basics Dojo! In this dojo, you will learn how to use Docker through hands-on challenges.
  Start by learning the basic commands and then progress to more advanced Docker operations.
  Make sure to take your time and dig deep into the concepts of containerization.

  Good luck, and remember to use the Docker documentation if you get stuck!
